The purpose of this project is to create an email reader/sender completely in java that can read emails and reply or send an email to someone. I worked alone on this project, I did have a partner but he finished the project without me, so I went ahead and did this instead (or I Tried) I learned pretty basic scenebuilder and javafx stuff, which I will love to sue in the future when im coding.I also learned how to use open source libraries to create code, but on top of all that I learned coding from scratch in 3 days can be very difficult. I had a few big obstacles that tripped me up. I was having trouble building the scenes and making everything work right (building the scenes was the easy part, it was just making sure one scene lead to another) and I also struggled alot with the session portion of the javamail library syntax. I ended up having to look it up. I just was not able to finish the inbox portion in time. I knew I would have trouble with FileIO. (which the way i saw it I would most likely have to use) even though it's easy for me to understand conceptually, I had trouble actuallly doing it, and it messed up my code many times. To make sure everything else ran, I just got rid of it. Otherwise, replying to the emails works, and sending out emails works, at least for my gmail account specifically (my wnetworth one was giving me problems)
